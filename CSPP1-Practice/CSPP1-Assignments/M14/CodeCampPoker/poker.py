        You will code this function. The goal of the function is to
        return a value that max can use to identify the best hand.
        As this function is complex we will progressively develop it.

    # By now you should have seen the way a card is represented.
    # If you haven't then go the main or poker function and print the hands
    # Each card is coded as a 2 character string. Example Kind of Hearts is KH
    # First character for face value 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K,A
    # Second character for the suit S (Spade), H (Heart), D (Diamond), C (Clubs)
    # What would be the logic to determine if a hand is a straight or flush?
    # Let's not think about the logic in the hand_rank function
    # Instead break it down into two sub functions is_straight and is_flush

    # check for straight, flush and straight flush
    # best hand of these 3 would be a straight flush with the return value 3
    # the second best would be a flush with the return value 2
    # third would be a straight with the return value 1
    # any other hand would be the fourth best with the return value 0
    # max in poker function uses these return values to select the best hand
