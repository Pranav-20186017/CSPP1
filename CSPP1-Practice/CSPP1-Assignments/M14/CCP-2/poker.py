        How do we find out if the given hand is a straight?
        The hand has a list of cards represented as strings.
        There are multiple ways of checking if the hand is a straight.
        Do we need both the characters in the string? No.
        The first character is good enough to determine a straight
        Think of an algorithm: given the card face value how to check if it a straight

        You will code this function. The goal of the function is to
        return a value that max can use to identify the best hand.
        As this function is complex we will progressively develop it.
        The first version should identify if the given hand is a straight
